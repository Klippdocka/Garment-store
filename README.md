## Garment store
*Scool project 1*
The task was to create a Website which was responsive and had a form inside it. The task was also to challenge your knowledge.

## What i did

I chose to build a simpler garment store with localstorage. The contact page is where the form are located and where you ask 'the store' about your order, payment and so on. 

To mention a few things I learnt during this project: how to use localstorage, build the website with flexbox and how to use an icon library.
